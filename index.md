### [Determining Retail Categories to Open in the Church Hill Neighborhood of Richmond, VA](https://github.com/mphill82/Retail_Inference_Capstone)
The purpose of this project is to determine new retail that should open in the Church Hill neighborhood of Richmond, VA.  I use geocoding, the Foursquare API, feature creation, PCA dimensionality reduction, and K-Means clustering.

### [ Predicting Titanic Passenger Survival](https://github.com/mphill82/Titanic-Kaggle)

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works. The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
